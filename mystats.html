            <h2>My Favorite Food: Chicken Biryani</h2>
            <p>My favorite food is <strong>Chicken Biryani</strong>. I love it for its exquisite blend of flavors
             and textures. The tender chicken pieces, marinated to perfection, combined with aromatic basmati rice 
             and an array of spices create a symphony of taste that is simply irresistible.<b>Chicken Biryani </b>is a 
             beloved South Asian dish known for its rich and aromatic flavors. It typically features marinated 
             chicken pieces, fragrant basmati rice, and a blend of spices like cardamom, cinnamon,and saffron. The 
             chicken is tender and infused with the spices, resulting in a savory and slightly spicy taste. 
             The dish is often garnished with fried onions, fresh mint leaves, and a drizzle of ghee, 
              enhancing its depth of flavor </p>
